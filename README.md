## About
The internet is filled with sites with many job hunting sites, and many of them contain a lot of fluff which is not relevant to the average job-seeker
... so, I am building this project to scrape few popular job listing sites to get their combined jobs 

Initially i will be scrapping the 3 sites
* TimesJobs.com
* Naukri.com
* Indeed.com
